 # Rails Getting Started with BDD
 
 This repo consists of a series of commits which implement the [Getting Started Blog App](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project) using Behavior Driven Development.
 
 Each step has a link to the actual commit diff on GitHub.  You can utilize that for more information.  Some commits are simply running commands, others require adding or updating files.
 
 After each step in this module, you should be committing your work at each step.  It's important to be well practiced at having granular, orderly, and descriptive commit messages. This is especially important when working with a team.
